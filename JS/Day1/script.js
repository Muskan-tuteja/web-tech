//! why we are using js.
// it is used for adding dynamic functionality  in oue website.
// history-  int sept 1995 brenden ech developed a langugage when he was working in netscape corporation. it was developed in only 10 days.
// initially it was named as mocha then name changes to life script then again netsacpe corpor. (owner of js) and sun micro-system (owner of java)
// together they made an agreement . thrn the name changes from lifescript to javascript. because java was very popular at that time.
// in 1997 javascript become ecma-script . ecma stands for european computer mnaufacturer association. they standared the javascript and added many features then diffrent ecma version launchged .
// the most famous versions are es6 and es9. the latestest version is es25.
//? features of es6 and es9.
// let,const,promises,symbols,map object,try-catch, async-await,set-object,array.from,array.entries,for-each.

//~ what is javascript -  it is a scripting as well as programming lang.it is object-based programming lang.it is partialy object-oriented prog lang.
// scripting- interpreture,programming - compiler.

//? features of the js -
//  1. dynamic in nature , variables are not bound to store any specific datatype.
// 2. interpreted : it means code will be checked line by line, from top to bottom and left to right.
// 3. synchronised : it means code will be executed in sequence  wise manner.
// 4. single-threaded :  it means only 1 task at a time, because it has only 1 call stack.
// 5. weakly or loosly typed language: it means semicolon is not mandatory, but if u are writting multiple statements in the same line then, you have to put semicolon.


// console.log("js");

// // var abc = 200;          // variable,identifier,operator,data-1.primitive 2.non-primitive

// //variable- are just like conatiner which is used to store the data. in js, we have three types of variable-var,let,const.
// // var- javaScript
// //let,const- ecmaScript

// //var
// declaration
// var a;
// //? initialization
// a = 2134;
// //? declaration and initialization(same line)
// var abc = 2345;
// //? re-declaration
// var abc;
// //? re-initialization
// abc = 78788;

// //let
// let a;
// // initialization
// a = 2134;
// // declaration and initialization(same line)
// var abc = 2345;  
// // re-initialization
// abc = 78788;

// //const
// // declaration and initialization(same line)
// var abc = 2345;



//! Identifier -
//  it is the name given to the variable.
//rules of identifier -1. it should not start eith number.
// 2. it should not start with special char only _ , $ are allowed.
// 3.spaces are not allowed.
// 4. reserved keywords are not allowed.
//it is a case-sensitive lang.which means x and X are treated differently.

a=100;
var a = 1000
console.log(a)
